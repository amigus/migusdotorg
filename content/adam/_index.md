I am a computer scientist and a technologist.
My first computer was an [8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) I got in 1985!
I learned to program in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC)
and use [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) on it.
I started programming in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
on a [SparcStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation) in 1993.
I _remember_ using [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser))
to read [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/)

I got a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Memorial University](https://mun.ca) in 2001.

I started my company, [The Migus Group](https://migusgroup.com) in February 2014.

I have public profiles as "amigus" on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/)
and [X](https://x.com/amigus/)
where, by the way, you can check the fingerprint of my GPG
[key](/adam/public.asc).

I write software and publish some of it in [Gists](https://gist.github.com/amigus)
and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/amigus).
