I am a computer scientist and an information technologist.
My first computer was an [8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) I got in 1985!
I learned to program in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC)
and use [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) on it.
I started programming in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
on a Sun [SPARCstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation) in 1993.
I _remember_ using [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser))
to read [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/)

I got a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Memorial University](https://mun.ca) in 2001.

I founded an IT services company, [The Migus Group](https://migusgroup.com) in 2014.

I write software and publish some of it in [Gists](https://gist.github.com/amigus)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/amigus).

I use this GPG [key](/adam/public.asc) to sign my commits and releases.

I have a profile [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/).
