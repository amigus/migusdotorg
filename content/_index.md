Yes, "adam" at this domain _is_ my email address!

I registered this domain to host my email in March 2002 when doing that with "yourlastname.org" was a thing!
Nowadays, I also use "amigus" as a handle on sites like
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/) and,
[X](https://x.com/amigus/),
where, incidentally, you can check the fingerprint of my GPG
[key](public.asc).

I write software and publish some of it in [Gists](https://gist.github.com/amigus).
I also maintain servers and publish my email server configuration in a public
[repository](https://github.com/amigus/cyrus-imap-server) on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/amigus) so check that out!

Thanks for taking the time to read this page. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‹
