__Yes, _adam_ at this domain is my email address!__

I bought this domain to host my email back in 2001 when doing that on _your last name_ .org was a thing.
Nowadays, I use _amigus_ as a handle on a lot of sites including
[GitHub](https://github.com/amigus/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/),
[X](https://x.com/amigus/) where you can verify my [GPG public key](public.asc) fingerprint.
