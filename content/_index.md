Yes, "adam" at this domain _is_ my email address! :email:

I registered this domain to host my email in March 2002 when doing that with "yourlastname.org" was a thing!
Nowadays, I also use "amigus" as a handle on sites like
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/) and
[X](https://x.com/amigus/)
where, by the way, you can check the fingerprint of my GPG
[key](public.asc). :lock_with_ink_pen:

I write software and publish some of it in [Gists](https://gist.github.com/amigus).
I also publish the scripts that build my email server in a public
[repo](https://github.com/amigus/cyrus-imap-server) on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/amigus)! :nerd_face:

I lead [The Migus Group](https://migusgroup.com).
It helps companies improve their cybersecurity through risk reduction and resiliency. :necktie:
