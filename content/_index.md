__Yes, _adam_ at this domain is my email address!__

I registered this domain to host my email in 2002.
Back then doing that on _yourlastname.org_ was a thing!
Nowadays, I use _amigus_ as a handle on sites like
[GitHub](https://github.com/amigus/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/),
[X](https://x.com/amigus/)
where you can verify my
[GPG public key](public.asc) fingerprint.
