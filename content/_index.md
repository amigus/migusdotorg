Yes, "adam" at this domain _is_ my email address!

I registered this domain to host my email in March 2002 when doing that with "yourlastname.org" was a thing!
Nowadays, I also use "amigus" as a handle on sites like
[GitHub](https://github.com/amigus/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/),
[X](https://x.com/amigus/),
where, incidentally, you can check the fingerprint of my GPG
[key](public.asc).

I write software and publish some of handy things in [Gists](https://gist.github.com/amigus).
I use [ByteCalculationFunctions.ps1](https://gist.github.com/amigus/555b34d0b1c872c33f3fee55c7ed17e9)
and [Create-VM.ps1](https://gist.github.com/amigus/9b68b2e25f5876505d4b81987bd05055)
all the time!
I manage servers so I publish things like this
[Makefile](https://gist.github.com/amigus/fb747e3b3630c496d79a4d9e089b5309)
that creates a boilerplate OpenLDAP 2.4.x server.
And I maintain this
[cyrus-imap-server](https://github.com/amigus/cyrus-imap-server)
setup which hosts my email.
