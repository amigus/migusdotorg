My name is Adam _Migus_ and, yes, _adam_ at this domain is my email address.
I bought this domain to host my email back in 2001 when doing that on _your last name_ .org was a thing.
Nowadays, I use _amigus_ as a handle on a lot of sites including
[GitHub](https://github.com/amigus/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/),
[X](https://x.com/amigus/).
I also use various "secure" messaging apps but I'm oldshool so please use my [GPG key](public.asc) for private messaging.

Thanks for reading this HTML page! 🙏
