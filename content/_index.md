My name is Adam _Migus_ and, yes, "adam" at this domain is my email address! 📧

I bought this domain to host my email back doing that on _your last name_ .org was a thing.
Keep in mind that it was 2001 so Gmail didn't exist yet.
Yahoo Mail did but I liked UNIX more so I decided to build my own server instead! 🤪

Nowadays, I use "amigus" as a handle on a lot of sites including
[GitHub](https://github.com/amigus/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amigus/),
[X](https://x.com/amigus/) and, nowadays, Gmail too. 😆

Did you read this whole page? Wow, thanks! 🙏
